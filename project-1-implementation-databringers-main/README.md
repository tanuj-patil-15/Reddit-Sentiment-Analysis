# Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

## Description

The project focuses on collecting real-time data from two primary sources: Reddit, and TMDB.For Reddit, it gathers domain data from various TV show-related subreddit threads. Lastly, it utilizes four crucial TMDB APIs to obtain TV show-related data, ensuring real-time database updates. The Reddit and TMDB APIs run on a daily schedule, storing data in MongoDB.

## Tech-stack

- `python`: The project is developed and tested using Python.
- `requests`: This popular HTTP networking library for Python (version 2.25.1) is used for API interactions.
- `MongoDB`: The project utilizes a NoSQL document database to store the collected data.
- `PyMongo`: This Python distribution contains tools for working with MongoDB (version 4.3.2).
- `Python-dotenv`: It reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables (version 2.25.1).

## Two Data-source Documentation

### Reddit

- We are using a list of subreddits:
  - Subreddit list = ['moviereviews', 'movies', 'TrueFilm', 'boxoffice', 'IMDbFilmGeneral', 'horror', 'scifi', 'filmmakers', 'animation',    'DC_Cinematic', 'Marvel', 'StarWars', 'JamesBond', 'pixar', 'lotr', 'harrypotter', 'flicks', 'MovieSuggestions']
  - Subreddit Data Retrieval: Real-time data is retrieved from the selected subreddit list.

### TMDB

- Real-time data is collected from The Movie Database (TMDB), a community-built TV and movie database, using various API endpoints:
  - `/movie/popular`: Get a list of movies ordered by popularity.
  - `/movie/{movie_id}`: Get the top level details of a movie by ID.
  - `/movie/{movie_id}/reviews`: Get the user reviews for a movie.
  - `/movie-reviews`: Get the user reviews for a movie.
  - `/movie/top_rated`: Get a list of movies ordered by rating.

1. To launch the scheduler for Reddit and TMDB APIs, run:
    python3 app.py
2. Run the Reddit stream using:
   python3 reddit.py
